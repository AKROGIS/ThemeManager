        <h2 id="intro">What is Theme Manager</h2>
		<p>
        <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span> simplifies access to GIS data.
        It provides the most benefit to occasional GIS users,
        or those in organizations with large data holdings.
        It can be used on a computer without any GIS software,
        but to get full access to all the features you must have
        ArcGIS Desktop installed (and licensed) on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
        The information provided below is intended to help new users get started quickly.
        If you have used previous versions of <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span>,
        you may want to review the section
        <a href="Help.html#whats-new">What’s New in <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager 3.0</span></a>
         in the main help document.
        </p>

        <h2 id="using">Using Theme Manager</h2>
        <p>
        For <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span> to be useful, you will need a theme list
        (an organized collection of the GIS data available to you).
        Anyone can create and edit theme lists, but usually they are provided
        by those most familiar with the data holdings in an organization.
        Theme lists ready for use are displayed in the <b>Themes</b> panel when the <b>Themes</b> tab
        is selected on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
        Do you have any theme lists loaded? (<a href="#browsing">Yes</a> or <a href="#loading">No</a>)
        </p>

        <h3 id="browsing">I have themes, let's go!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Browsing</li>
            <p>
            Browse the treeview of themes just like a file browser.
            When you see a theme that is interesting, select it by clicking on it and this document
            will be replaced by detailed information about the theme.
            </p>

            <li>Adding to a map</li>
            <p>
            If you want to add a theme to a map, just double click it, or drag and drop it onto an open map document.
            Note that some items cannot be added to a map. The typical ones are: theme lists
            (<img src="images/DB.png" alt="Theme list icon"/> or
            <img src="images/DB_lock.png" alt="Read only theme list icon"/>), categories
            (<img src="images/category.png" alt="Category icon"/>) and
            sub-themes (icons vary, but text is always gray).
            </p>

            <li>Preview</li>
            <p>
            If you want to want see what a theme looks like before adding it to your map, first select it in the
            tree view, then click on the <b>Preview</b> tab above.
            </p>

            <li>Searching</li>
            <p>
            If you are looking for something in particular, enter some defining text in the search box above
            and press the enter key.  A list of themes will be presented in the <b>Search Results</b> tab.
            </p>

            <li>More Searching</li>
            <p>
            If the number of themes returned is too many, you can refine the search by right clicking
            on a category (in either the <b>Themes</b>, <b>Favorites</b>, or <b>Search Results</b> tabs)
            and selecting search
            from the pop-up context menu.  In this case you will only be searching the themes in the
            selected category.
            </p>

            <li>Favorites</li>
            <p>
            If you find a theme that may be useful again, you can add it to your list of favorites by
            clicking on the star (<img src="images/FavoriteStar_16x16.png" alt="Add to favorites icon"/>) in the tool bar.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <p>
        That's it, you have now mastered the most common uses of <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span>.
        If you are interested in creating your own theme lists, please read on.  If you would like
        to explore these topics in more detail, please see the <a href="Help.html">main help document</a>.
        Help is also available at any time by clicking <a href="Help.html"><img src="images/help.png" alt="Help icon"/></a>
        on the tool bar, or selecting
        <b>Help->View Help</b> from the main menu.
        </p>

        <h3 id="loading">My Themes tab is empty</h3>
        <p>
        You will need a theme list to continue.  You have two options:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Load an existing theme list.</li>

            <p>
            Click on the open icon (<img src="images/open.png" alt="Open theme list icon"/>) in the tool bar
            (or select <b>File->Open Theme List</b> from the main menu),
            and browse to the location of a theme list.  Hopefully someone has told you where you can find one.
            If so, click the open button and your theme list will be loaded.  You are now ready for <a href="#browsing">theme browsing</a>.
            </p>

            <li>Create a new theme list.</li>
            <p>
            See the following section.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="creating">Creating Theme Lists</h2>
        <p>
        Creating a theme list is easy, but creating a useful theme list may require a bit more GIS knowledge
        than this quick start document provides.  If you get stuck, see the <a href="Help.html"><span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span> help</a>, or consult
        your GIS specialist.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a new theme list</li>
            <p>
            Select <b>File->New Theme List</b> from the main menu
            (or click <img src="images/newDocument.png" alt="new document icon"/> on the tool bar,
            and then select <img src="images/newDB.png" alt="new theme list icon"/> <b>New Theme List</b> from the pop-up menu).
            </p>

            <li>Adding Themes</li>
            <p>
            Using windows file explorer to browse to any ESRI layer file (*.lyr).  Select one or more files and drag and drop them
            onto your theme list.  The layer files and any associated metadata will be added to your theme list.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note: <span class="tm_name">Theme Manager</span> is not limited to layer files. Any file or document can be added as a theme,
            however only ESRI layer files and map documents provide sub theme expansion and automatic metadata discovery.
            If you do not have any layer files, they will need to be created in ArcMap.  Consult the ArcMap help if necessary.
            </p>

            <li>Organizing Themes</li>
            <p>
            First select (left mouse click) your theme list in the Themes panel,
            then select <b>File->New Category</b> from the main menu
            (or click <img src="images/newDocument.png" alt="new document icon"/>) on the tool bar,
            and then select <img src="images/newCategory.png" alt="new category icon"/> <b>New Category</b>
            from the pop-up menu.
            Once a category is created, you can drag and drop existing items (themes or categories) into the
            new category folder.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can also create nested (sub) categories if you select an existing category instead of the theme list before
            invoking the <b>New Category</b> command.
            </p>

            <li>Changing Names</li>
            <p>
            To change the name of a theme list, category or theme,
            first click on the <b>Properties</b> tab above, then select the item you wish to change.
            Click in the top text box (labeled Theme List: Category: or Theme:) and change the name.
            The name will update in the tree view as soon as you click on (or tab into) another property.
            You can edit (or add) information in any of the text boxes that are not disabled.
            All fields except the name are optional.
            </p>

            <li>Saving</li>
            <p>
            Click on the save icon (<img src="images/save.png" alt="Save theme list icon"/>)  in the tool bar,
            (or select <b>File->Save</b> or <b>File->Save As...</b> from the main menu).
            If the save icon is grayed out, then there are no new changes in your theme list that need to be saved.
            If your theme list has never been saved before, you will be prompted for a file name/location
            where it should be saved.
            </p>

            <li>About metadata</li>
            <p>
            Themes (as well as categories and theme lists) can have additional information about them
            displayed in the metadata panel.  Themes will automatically discover any associated metadata,
            so there is nothing more that needs to be done. However
            If no metadata was found, you can specify it by editing the <b>Metadata</b>
            (<b>Url/Metadata</b> for a theme list or category) field.
            This field can contain a web site (http://...), a path to an XML metadata file, or a path to a data source in
            a geodatabase that has embeded metadata.  If the metadata is an XML file you can use the browse (...) button
            to find it.
            Themes will extract additional information (publication date, description, ...) from metadata
            to help with searching.  IF your theme has no metadata you can add your own information in these
            fields, or you can use the ArcCatalog to create metadata for your theme.
            Consult the ArcCatalog help if necessary.
            </p>

        </ul>
