New features - User Interface
=============================
Use WPF for more elegant UI
Use flyout/dockable windows (instead of tab panels)
Separate Toolbar, Tree browser, and metadata windows to allow repositioning.
Implement floating toolbars
implement closable toolbars
context menu on form to add/remove menus/toolbars
Fill metadata pane with instructions on first startup.
New icon/function should switch to the last used tool.
Add description to status bar, and/or tooltip

Allow font/color choices for different node types.

Code reorganization (refactoring)
===================================
Use a metadata hashtable (so duplicate metadata files are not loaded twice for different themes)
If drag over a tab, then switch to that tab.
Add Logic for new XML versions.
Remove dependency on MSXML2 (Stylesheets.cs)
The TMNode._datastore should be a ThemeData Object, which may have a datastore property.


Questions
==================
Do I want to clone or reference TMNode when copying.  I think I need to clone.
 - edits in favorites should not show up in Theme List
Should default search with multiple words be search all or search any.

Improvements
===============
Faster Loading
  - Save and read theme lists as XML
  - Stand alone TM does not connect to license server until it needs to.

Doesn't write to the registry
drag'n'drop/copy'n'paste of themes and categories in all trees
Create/Edit categories in favorites and searches
Full editing of searches and favorites
Saves favorites and searches

Improvements supported but not yet implemented
==============================================
display/search metadata in SDE feature classes
layer groups can be nested arbitrarily deep.

New Ideas:
===========
Create a new node type which is a shortcut.
 * Favorites and searches can be shortcuts to a themelist
 * these shortcuts can be organized with categories/sub categorys.
 * favorites and searches can only have a categories or shortcuts.
 * short cuts must point to a category or theme (not themelist or subtheme) in a themelist.
 * Shortcuts may become broken if the data they point to is missing or reorganized.
