            Highlights
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tested and developed for ArcMap 10.0 (also works with 9.3)</li>
            <li>Completely new. Re-written in C# with .Net Framework 3.5</li>
            <li>New XML based theme list format (faster loading, searching and saving)</li>
            <li>Several key metadata fields can be stored in the theme list to improve search speed and results</li>
            <li>Select multiple themes</li>
            <li>Drag and drop multiple themes to add them to ArcMap</li>
            <li>Drag and drop multiple layer files to add them to a theme list</li>
            <li>Double click to open selected themes (typically in ArcMap)</li>
            <li>Quick search from the toolbar</li>
            <li>Search just a category or subset of themes</li>
            <li>A theme can now be any document (but only ESRI layer files (*.lyr) and Map documents (*.mxd/t)) provide sub-theme expansion and automatic metadata discovery</li>
            <li>ArcMap document when added as themes will reveal all their data frames and layers</li>
            <li>Themes can be previewed with an embeded map viewer</li>
            <li>All theme properties are managed on the properties tab in the main form</li>
            <li>Layers/Maps can have group layers nested arbitrarily deep</li>
            <li>Favorites can be organized into categories</li>
            <li>Any category (including those in search results or favorites) can be saved as a new theme list</li>
            <li>Themes can be sort ascending, descending, or unsorted (by turning on an advanced option)</li>
            <li>Various administrative reports are available (through an advanced option). These reports provide diagnostic lists on the state of a selected theme list</li>
            <li>Themes can be reloaded if the source document has changed</li>
            <li>Metadata can be rescanned if the source document has changed</li>
            <li>Theme lists can be edited with cut/copy/paste and well as drag and drop</li>
            <li>Changes to a theme list are not permanent until you explicitly save.  Changes can be discarded by quitting without saving changes</li>
        </ul>

        Important Change:
        </h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Writing to version 2.2 theme lists is not supported</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Old theme lists can be read and saved as new theme lists, but the old theme lists cannot
            be edited and saved in the Microsoft Access format supported with prior versions.
        </p>
